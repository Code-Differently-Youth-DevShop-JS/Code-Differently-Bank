# Code Differently Bank
The building of this application will focus on pseudo-coding, functionality, and core developing concepts.

## Instructions 
- Fork this repository to your GitHub.

## Prerequisite 
- JavaScript Fundamentals

## Objectives
- Pseudocode
- Make it work
- Make it dry 
- Make it pretty

## Project Components 
- Component 1: Pseudocode
- Component 2: Code to work
- Component 3: Separation of Concerns
- Component 4: Make It DRY/Pretty

## Mandatory Functionality

1.  Login page for users must have: Email, password, and pin number to login.
2.  Users have a checking and savings account.
3. Users can deposit money into their checking and/or savings account.
4. Users can withdraw money from their checking and/or savings account.
5. Users accounts cannot have a negative balance or below $0. 
6. Users are able to see the balance in either account.
7. The checking and savings accounts must work independently of each other.


### Component 1: Pseudocode 

**What is Pseudocode?**
- Pseudocode is an informal way of programming description that does not require any strict programming language syntax or underlying technology considerations. It is used for creating an outline or a rough draft of a program.

You should spend about 20-30 minutes simply planning out your project. This is where you use plain english to break down each aspect of functionality for the project. Take the project requirements as the start of your blueprint and break it down bit by bit.

**Example:** Users need to be able to input a dollar amount when they deposit or withdraw money.


### Component 2: Make it work

Once you have you have your pseudocode, you can now start building your application piece by piece. Take the blueprint of your pseudocode to build the functionality and key components. The key here is make it work, does not matter if it looks good, get the program to run first. 




### Component 3: Separation of Concerns

**Separation of concerns is a guiding principal in software development centered on the idea that programs should have distinct sections, with each section being responsible for its own concern.**

Once you have gotten your code to work, now you can start to clean it up a bit. You do that by separating your concerns. An example would be a `function` that has too much logic, handling several different things, which can be broken down into two separate functions doing distinct actions.


### Component 4: Make It DRY/Pretty

**`Don't repeat yourself` is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.**


You have gotten your program to work successfully, you have separated your concerns, now make it DRY. Any syntax that can be shortened or broken down, please do so. This also allows to organize your code, an example would be leaving comments above certain functionalities to label them, or maybe you have all of your deposit functionality in one aspect of your syntax and the savings functionality in another. 


## Style and Design 
The design of this web application is up to you, but it must incorporate CSS and/or you can use a CSS framework/library such as Bootstrap, MaterialUI, Tailwind etc. You can find a list of the most popular CSS framework/libraries [here](https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-css-frameworks).
